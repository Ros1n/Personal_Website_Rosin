# Personal_Website_Rosin(v1.0)

This is a personal website based on HTML + CSS + JS, runs on Azure server wtih Azure App services. You can visit it by entering URL: http://pwpwebapp.azurewebsites.net(Thanks for Microsoft and Azure to let me used a free domain name!). The main goal for this website is to create a blog for recording my lastest learning, and reinventing wheels to test my knowledge.

## Reference
*The most useful framework that helps me a lot is Layui. It provides basic layout and sidebar for me to fill the content. You are welcome to visit their website: http://www.layui.com/.
*The icons(Skype, LinkedIn, email...) is refered from http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.2.0/css/font-awesome.min.cs. You can look for what you want in their website: http://fontawesome.io/.
*The font is Roboto Condensed, refered from Googlelepis.

## To Do
